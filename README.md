# Geospatial Wheels Flatlinks

A [PEP503 compliant index](https://nathanjmcdougall.github.io/geospatial-wheels-flatlinks/) for installation of geospatial wheels on Windows.

## Acknowledgements

This index is totally dependent on the work of [Christoph Gohlke](https://github.com/cgohlke) to tirelessly build and host wheels for the Python geospatial stack on Windows.

Using this index together with indexes for other platforms would not be possible without the work of [Astral](https://astral.sh/), with [uv's powerful index support](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/configuration/indexes/#package-indexes).
